        Anagram is a string that contains exact same characters as another string

        Inputs: 
            strs: Array of strings
        Outputs:
            - 2d array where all anagrams are grouped in individual arrays
        
        approach:
            - Use hashmap (default_dict of list)  to store bucket counts for each string
            - iterate over all strings and get bucket counts
            - convert buckets to tuples and store in hashmap
                - tuple bucket is the key and str is the value
                - if bucket already exists we can just apppend onto the str
